### Rusty Journal
Rusty Journal is a simple command-line application that allows you to manage your to-do list efficiently. The project demonstrates how to:
- Parse command-line arguments using `structopt`.
- Handle errors gracefully with `anyhow`.
- Use `serde` and `chrono` for JSON serialization and timestamp management.
- Manage tasks with basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
